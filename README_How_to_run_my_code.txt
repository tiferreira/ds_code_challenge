My code to the tasks are all save indivudally in Rmd files. They are named Task_*rmd. Where there are files names Task_*_*.rmd it refers to the overall task and the numerated sub requests. 

All files run on their own and are not dependant on other files. 

For task 4 I chose sub-task 2 and sub-task 3. 

My files are: 
Task_2
Task_3_1
Task_3_2
Task_4_2
Task_4_3
